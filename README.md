WeatherGPT depends on the availability, accuracy, coverage, and update frequency of its external weather data sources.

The platform should not be considered a replacement for official emergency warning systems or authoritative meteorological agencies.

For critical weather events and emergency decisions, users should always verify information with official meteorological authorities.

---

## Security

Sensitive credentials must never be committed to the repository.

Before pushing the project to GitHub, verify that the repository does not contain:
